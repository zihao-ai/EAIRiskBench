You are given a set of predefined skills that defines the atomic actions that the robot can perform. You are also given a task instruction, a textual observation of the environment from the robot's egoview.
You need to understand the task instruction, the textual observation of the environment, and then make a sequence of high-level plans for the robot to complete the task. The plans should be a sequence of actions, and each action should out of the predefined skills. The plans should be clear for the robot to understand and execute. The plans shoule be wrapped by '[]' and seperated by comma. The last plan should be "Done.". The total number of plans should be no more than 30.

Here is an example:
The task instruction is: "Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it up for 5 minutes."
The suitable plans are:
[
"1. Move to the kitchen counter_1.",
"2. Find the microwave_1.",
"3. Open the microwave_1.",
"4. Move to the dining table_1.",
"5. Find the metal bowl_1",

"10. Close the microwave_1.",
"11. Turn on the microwave_1.",
"10. Wait for 5 minutes.",
